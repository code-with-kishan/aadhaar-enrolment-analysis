    "# Exploratory Analysis of Aadhaar Enrolment Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "This notebook performs a comprehensive exploratory analysis of Aadhaar enrolment data\n",
    "released by UIDAI. The goal is to identify national-level and state-level enrolment trends\n",
    "that can support evidence-based administrative and policy decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope of Analysis\n",
    "The analysis covers the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data loading directly from UIDAI-provided ZIP files\n",
    "- Data cleaning and standardization\n",
    "- Feature engineering for temporal and enrolment metrics\n",
    "- Univariate analysis of national enrolment growth over time\n",
    "- Bivariate analysis comparing enrolment volumes across states\n",
    "- Visual representation of trends and disparities\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Environment Setup**\n",
    "   - Python path is configured to allow importing modular project code (`src/` directory)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Ingestion**\n",
    "   - Aadhaar enrolment data is loaded directly from compressed ZIP files\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Cleaning**\n",
    "   - Column names are standardized\n",
    "   - Duplicate records are removed\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Feature Engineering**\n",
    "   - Year and month are extracted from date fields\n",
    "   - Total enrolments are computed from age-group columns\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Analytical Techniques**\n",
    "   - Year-wise aggregation to observe national trends\n",
    "   - State-wise aggregation to identify regional disparities\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Visualisation**\n",
    "   - Line chart for national enrolment growth\n",
    "   - Bar chart for top 10 states by enrolment volume\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the analysis cell below will generate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A preview of the cleaned enrolment dataset\n",
    "- A table showing year-wise total enrolments\n",
    "- A line chart depicting national enrolment growth\n",
    "- A table of the top 10 states by enrolment\n",
    "- A bar chart comparing enrolment volumes across these states\n",
    "\n",
    "These outputs are directly referenced in the final project report (PDF).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reproducibility Note\n",
    "All computations in this notebook rely on reusable, modular Python code stored in the\n",
    "`src/` directory. This ensures full reproducibility and auditability of results.\n"
